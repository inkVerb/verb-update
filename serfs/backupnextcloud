# This backs up the installed Nextcloud webapp data folder by exporting the database, and siteconfig file into one downloadable vbak file in the "vip" folder and symlinked to the main site domain.
## This is separate from other backups because Nextcloud's developers make exporting difficult by more or less "welding" the app to the server. But, the export file is also smaller.
## This mainly backs up the user files and database, not the app itself.

# How to use:
## ./backupnextcloud [securename 0-9, a-z, and A-Z only, optional] [-nl for no link, optional dep]

# Eg:
## ./backupnextcloud 583
## ./backupnextcloud 7aJk -nl
## ./backupnextcloud b
