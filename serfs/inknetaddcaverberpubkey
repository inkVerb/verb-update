# This adds/updates a CA Verber's public signing key to the known_hosts of the local Verber Client
## Prerequisite: inknetmakeverberclient (which runs this automatically at the end)
# Client Config - to have the CA public cert on the Client, so the Client can recognize the known remote host via CA cert
## With this, theoretically, the CA Verber can change its own host certificate and Clients will still recognize it

# Note: you can use underscores or dots

# How to use:
## ./inknetaddcaverberpubkey [secondary CA Verber name - optional]

# Eg: (for primary CA Verber / Inker)
## ./inknetaddcaverberpubkey

# Eg: (for secondary CA Verber)
## ./inknetaddcaverberpubkey two1.two.verb.ink
## ./inknetaddcaverberpubkey two1_two_verb_ink
## ./inknetaddcaverberpubkey two1.ink.inkisaverb.com
## ./inknetaddcaverberpubkey two1_ink_inkisaverb_com
