# This runs installpostfix and some extra scripts to setup a backup email server on this Verber
## Prerequisite: setupverb of course, and verbemail if you wish an email tld other than .email
## Prerequisite: this Verber should be linked to the backup server already.
## Roundcube and PostfixAdmin will be disallowed by running this.

# DEV NOTE: This is by no means finished. It is only a start to set config files.

# How to use:
## ./inkvmailinstallbackmx

# Eg:
## ./inkvmailinstallbackmx

SERVER=$1
