# This script points your-name.verb.one subdomains to custom-made subdomains, 

# How to use:

# Eg: (This will point name.verb.vip to lucky.your-name.verb.vip)
## ./pointvip lucky

# Type ./pointvip -h for help


# Include the configs
. /opt/verb/conf/sitenameip
. /opt/verb/conf/siteurilist

Examples:
 ./pointvip lucky (points ${vipURI} to lucky.your-name.verb.one
 ./pointvip verb.vip (resets ${vipURI} to point to itself)
 you may use any subdomain you want except
 verb.vip, which will reset ${vipURI}
 and
 cgi, fpt, files, fossil, mysql, net2ftp, repo which are already taken."
