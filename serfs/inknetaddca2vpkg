# This puts the login credentials into the right place for a Verber
## This assumes that the key has been already uploaded to the CA, signed, downloaded from the CA, and put on the server in the www/vip folder

# How to use:
## ./inknetaddca2vpkg [CA2 Host/Name] [sec path code from CA Verber - optional, will prompt if not entered here]

ICA2V=$1
CA2VNAME="$(/bin/echo ${ICA2V} | sed 's/\./_/g')"

# Include the config
. /opt/verb/conf/inknet/2cav.${CA2VNAME}.cnf

# Verify working home directory
cd ~/

# If sec path not specified in command line

# Download the package
/usr/bin/wget -q https://${CAVERBERHOST}/inknet/${SECPATH}/${CLIENTNAME}.ink --no-check-certificate

# Unpack

# Finish
/bin/echo "The CA-signed cert for this Verber has been installed. This Verber may now use inkNet to connect to the Inker for other services, such as inkCert."
